# project-paper-clip
The project is meant to portray a ticket vendor that can be used as both a platform for sale and for purchase.The tickets are hosted on a server and accessed through the website.

Using json-server I have been able to mimic a backend with simple data. The data is displayed once the DOM content has completed loading. I have been able to achieve this using asynchronous execution of code (e.g using fetch()) as well as DOM manipulation (e.g using querySelector()).


The user (both vendor)is required to create an account to facilitate validation the event and tickets being put up for sale. This is isn order to maintain a level of oversight to keep bad apples away. The events being posted are organised completely separate from the website i.e indepently

Further planned improvements include:
1. Backend (create a system to roll out the tickets)
2. Improved styling (better visuals)
3. Improved functionality (More useful event outcomes)
4. Ability to create accounts (for users)
5. Ability to complete purchases (integrating a payment API)
